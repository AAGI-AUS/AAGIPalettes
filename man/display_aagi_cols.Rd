\usage{
display_aagi_cols(name, n = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{A either \code{aagi_colours} or a palette name from the lists below.}

\item{n}{\code{Numeric} Number of different colours in the palette, minimum 3,
maximum depends on the palette. Defaults to \code{5}.  Ignored if name is
\code{aagi_colours}.

There are 3 types of palettes provided, qualitative, sequential and
diverging.
\enumerate{
\item{qualitative palettes are suited to ...}
\item{Sequential palettes are suited to ordered data that progress from low
to high.  Lightness steps dominate the look of these schemes, with light
colours for low data values to dark colours for high data values.}
\item{Diverging palettes put equal emphasis on mid-range critical values and
extremes at both ends of the data range.  The critical class or break in
the middle of the legend is emphasized with light colours and low and high
extremes are emphasized with dark colours that have contrasting hues.}
}

The sequential palettes names are:
\itemize{
\item \dQuote{aagi_blues},
\item \dQuote{aagi_bright_greens},
\item \dQuote{aagi_BrYl},
\item \dQuote{aagi_greens},
\item \dQuote{aagi_greys},
\item \dQuote{aagi_reds},
\item \dQuote{aagi_oranges},
\item \dQuote{aagi_RdYl},
\item \dQuote{aagi_teals},
\item \dQuote{aagi_TlGnYl},
\item \dQuote{aagi_TlYl},
\item \dQuote{aagi_yellows}
}

All the sequential palettes are available in variations from 3 different
values up to 11 different values.

The diverging palettes are:
\itemize{
\item \dQuote{aagi_BuOr},
\item \dQuote{aagi_BuYl},
\item \dQuote{aagi_GnYl},
\item \dQuote{aagi_RdBu},
\item \dQuote{aagi_RdTl},
\item \dQuote{aagi_TlGn}
}

All the diverging palettes are available in variations from 3 different
values up to 11 different values.

For qualitative palettes, the lowest number of distinct values available
always is 3, but the largest number is different for different palettes.
It is given together with the palette names in the following table.}
