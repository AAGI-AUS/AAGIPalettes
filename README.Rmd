# {AAGIPalettes} AAGI Colours and Colour Palettes for R <img align="right" src="man/figures/logo.png">

This repository contains the code for the R package {AAGIPalettes}, which once installed in your R session (local or RStudio Server), provides helper functions, data and palettes for working with AAGI colours.

## Installation instructions

You can install {AAGIPalettes} like so:

```r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("AAGI-AUS/AAGIPalettes")
```

## Quick start

Following are some quick examples of {AAGIPalettes} functionality.

### Official Colours

{AAGIPalette} provides a data object of the official AAGI colours from the comms guide.
You can see the hex code values in a named vector like so.

```{r view_official_colours}
library("AAGIPalettes")

aagi_colours
```

### Viewing Colours

{AAGIPalette} provides limited functionality for viewing and working with colours.
You can plot the colours or palettes in the package as follows.

```{r plot_official_colours}
display_aagi_cols("aagi_colours")
```

Display the "aagi_BuOr" palette with 9 stops.

```{r plot_BuOR}
display_aagi_cols(name = "aagi_BuOr", n = 9)
```

### Interpolating Colours

```{r interpolate_colours}
library(ggplot2)

x <- interpolate_aagi_colours()
# round the weights to clean up the legend, this is just an e.g. after all...
wt_vals <- x(length(unique(round(mtcars$wt, 1))))

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = hp, colour = as.factor(round(wt, 1)))) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_colour_manual("Weight", values = wt_vals)
```
