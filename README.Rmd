# {AAGIPalettes} Provide AAGI Colours for R <img align="right" src="man/figures/logo.png">

This repository contains the code for the R package {AAGIPalettes}, which once installed in your R session (local or RStudio Server), provides helper functions, data and palettes for working with AAGI colours.

## Installation instructions

You can install {AAGIPalettes} like so:

```r
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github("AAGI-Org-AU-Public/AAGIPalettes",
                        dependencies = TRUE
)
```

## Quick start

Following are some quick examples of {AAGIPalettes} functionality.

### Official Colours

{AAGIPalette} provides a data object of the official AAGI colours from the comms guide.
You can see the hex code values in a named vector like so.

```{r view_official_colours}
library("AAGIPalettes")

aagi_colours
```

### Viewing Colours

{AAGIPalette} provides limited functionality for viewing and working with colours.
You can plot the colours or palettes in the package as follows.

```{r plot_official_colours}
display_aagi_cols("aagi_colours")
```

Display the "aagi_BuOr" palette with 9 stops.

```{r plot_BuOR}
display_aagi_cols(name = "aagi_BuOr", n = 9)
```
