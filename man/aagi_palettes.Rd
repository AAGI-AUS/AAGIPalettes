for more.}

\item{name}{\code{Character} A string value with the name of the desired palette.}

\item{direction}{\code{Integer} Sets the order of colours in the scale.  If \code{1},
the default order is used. If \code{-1}, the order of colours is reversed.}

\description{
\acronym{AAGI} palettes for use in charts and plots based on official
\acronym{AAGI} colours and interpolated to provide more colours for use in
maps and other graphical outputs.  These palettes are intended to be
colour-blind friendly, while still being based on and include official
\acronym{AAGI} colours but not all will be official \acronym{AAGI} colours.
They are are palettes that are intended to be useful for creating plots
that incorporate come official  \acronym{AAGI} colours but they may not all
be official \acronym{AAGI} colours.

\section{Methods}{
The colours were taken from the \acronym{AAGI} communications style guide
colour palette. In some cases, \emph{e.g.}, \code{aagi_red}, \verb{#8b0b00} value,
did not exist in the official palette and was generated by taking the
complimentary colour of the \code{aagi_teal}, \verb{#00808b} value. The darkest and
lightest values used in interpolating the colours were selected from the
"Tint Colour Variation" list of this website,
\url{https://www.colorhexa.com/c5856d}, using the \acronym{AAGI}
hexadecimal colour code as the input. The interpolated values were all
generated using \url{http://www.vis4.net/palettes/}, ensuring that all
palettes are colourblind safe.

When \code{name} is any other palette, the minimum value for \code{n} is 3 and
maximum will vary from 7 to 9 or 11 stops based on the palette requested.

When \code{name} is \code{aagi_paired}, \code{n} must be 2, 4 or 6 and will have one each of
light(er) and one dark(er) related colours.

\examples{
# sequential blues with 7 stops
aagi_palettes(n = 7, name = "aagi_blues", direction = 1)

# diverging red teal colours with 11 stops
aagi_palettes(n = 11, name = "aagi_RdTl", direction = 1)

# paired palette with 4 colours (2 sets)
aagi_palettes(n = 4, name = "aagi_paired")
